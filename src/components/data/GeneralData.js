      "Design and synthesis of higher order Foldamers for Biomimetic Functions",
    details:
      "Foldamers are artificially synthetic oligomers that adopt folded defined conformations such as sheets or helices which closely resembles secondary motifs of proteins and other biopolymers. Therefore, this type of synthetic compounds has huge potential to mimic biological functions. These are produced in a diverse approach: from stepwise addition of monomers to folded oligomers and structured synthetic polymers to artificial nucleic acids or protein sequences produced by directed evolution methods. We would like to use self-assembly approach to create higher order structures for molecular recognition, artificial photosynthesis, catalysis, photoredox catalysis and molecular electronics.",

    details:
      "The mass transport between the external and interior environment of the cells is an essential process in all living organisms for survival. Nature performs this process elegantly by creating well-defined channels by natural proteins such as Aquaporin. The structure and size of the channels play a crucial role in selectivity and in transport efficiency, where the molecules are transported overcoming high energetic barriers. We aim to create artificial ion channels that can be applied for mass transport along lipid bilayers by using self-aggregating macrocycles. In addition, we would also like to explore the uses of these self-aggregated systems for molecular recognition, molecular electronics, and other functional materials.",
