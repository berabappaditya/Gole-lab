    details:
      "Foldamers are artificially synthetic oligomers that adopt folded defined conformations such as sheets or helices which closely resembles secondary motifs of proteins and other biopolymers. Therefore, this type of synthetic compounds has huge potential to mimic biological functions. These are produced in a diverse approach: from stepwise addition of monomers to construct folded oligomers to artificial mucleic acid or protein sequeces that produced by directed evolution methods. We would like to use self-assembly approach to create higher order foldameric structures for molecular recognition, artificial photosynthesis, catalysis, photoredox catalysis and molecular electronics.",

    details:
      "The mass transport between the external and interior environment of the cells is an essential process in all living organisms for survival. Nature performs this process elegantly by using well-defined channels of natural proteins such as Aquaporin. The structure and size of the channels play a crucial role in selectivity and in transport efficiency, where the molecules are transported overcoming high energetic barriers. We aim to create artificial ion channels by using self-aggregating macrocycles that can be applied for mass transport across lipid bilayers. In addition, we would also like to explore the uses of these self-aggregated systems for molecular recognition, molecular electronics, and other functional materials.",

    details:
      "In biological systems, enzymes create well-defined confined space to enforce catalytic activity with very high selectivities and precision. Even though all enzymatic activities are not well understood so far, it is mostly assumed that the confinement effect reduces the activation barrier by pre-organizing the reactants which facilitate their catalytic activities. Inspired by enzymatic functions we are interested in creating unique artificial molecular hosts for host-guest chemistry, sensing, drug delivery, and catalysis to explore their confined environment.",

    details:
      "Materials that become stronger upon applying force/stress have a great interest in material science and innovation. Although this phenomenon has been very common in nature and plays a crucial role in a variety of biological processes, unfortunately, those are very difficult to be realized artificially.The adaptive mechanical response of many soft materials is mediated by mechanoactive building blocks. A prime example is the so-called /“catch bond/”. Unlike normal (slip) bonds, these bonds strengthen their grip with increasing tension. In our continuous effort towards material innovation, we would like to create a simple synthetic ‘catch bond’ that predictably exhibits reversible strengthened bonding with increasing load. Subsequently, the ‘catch bond’ can be introduced in a polymer network to study the effect on mechanical properties such as strain-stiffening and resistance to damage. The supramolecular chemistry approach will be considered to achieve such materials, which have a folded and an unfolded state and can be reversible.",
